#If you want to get access to packages that haven't been released on CRAN, you have to edit your .Rprofile. To do this run 
 
#```{r}

# To use packgaes from FHI write:

Write install.packages("LIBRARY NAME"), see an example with some packages you will need to use below:

```{r}


list.of.packages <- c("org", "fs", "data.table", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "grid", "flowCore", "flowSOM", "betareg", "ComplexHeatmap", "Rmarkdown")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages) > 0) {
  install.packages(new.packages)
}


```
